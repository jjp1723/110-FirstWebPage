About John Pionzio
</h1>

<p>
Hello, I am John Pionzio
<p>
I have a passion for video games, and have played them for as long as I can remember.  Some of my favorite games include the main Nintendo titles, the Halo games, Spore, World of Tanks, and many more.  I have also created my own games, both as a part of a club as well as on my own.  Probably the largest game I have made was Potato Ninja, a 2D platformer that I helped make in 11th grade.  This is the only game I have worked on that is available online, and can be found here:

<p>I hope to create more games in the future, and hope my education at RIT will help me in this endevoir.

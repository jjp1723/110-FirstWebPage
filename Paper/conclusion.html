	Conclusion:
	<p>
	Not many people know about the Universal vs Nintendo case, and that it potentially could have crippled the gaming company or changed the way trademarks are handled in the U.S.  It would have most certainly meant that Donkey Kong, or perhaps even Mario, would never have appeared in any future games, and that Nintendo itself may no longer exist as a gaming company as it does today, so the fact that Nintendo won is one that should be relished.  I personally do, as Nintendo is my favorite gaming company.  I find it inspiring that by John Kirby winning the case for Nintendo, his name became immortalized within popular media, as he now has one of the most popular gaming characters of all time named after him.  This case and modern day events have also demonstrated how companies who once opposed each other can make amends and work together to create something new and exciting, as shown by the development of Nintendo World.  I personally find this outcome to be the best possible, as not only has Nintendo grown and evolved into a staple of modern video games, but also has made amends with former adversaries, and may continue to grow and evolve into newer forms of media, creating brand new content for all to enjoy.

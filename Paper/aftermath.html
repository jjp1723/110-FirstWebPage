	The Aftermath:
	<p>
	In the years since the lawsuit, Nintendo has expressed their gratitude towards John Kirby first by “gifting him a sailboat named after the character he’d spent so many years defending in court” (9), the Donkey Kong.  However, this isn’t the one way they expressed their gratitude, and this may have been obvious from the start since his name seemed so familiar.  This is because in 1992, “the company decided to name one of their future stars after a lawyer” (9), the adorable puffball Kirby.  Kirby is one of if not my favorite off all Nintendo characters and franchises, and likely wouldn’t have existed had Nintendo lost the case against Universal and was forced to pay the victor millions upon millions.  Such a thing would have likely crippled Nintendo as a gaming company, as it was far from being as established as it is today, and so they likely wouldn’t have been able to make and market more games.  Even if Kirby had been developed after this potential loss, he most certainly would have been named the same, as Nintendo wouldn’t have any motivation to name a game character after a lawyer who lost them the case.  In fact, Kirby’s original name was meant to be Popopo, making his name much more like his nemesis in his first game, King Dedede, however Kirby’s but this was obviously changed.  Allegedly, Masahiro Sakurai, the chief developer behind Kirby, hadn’t even known where the name “Kirby” came from.  John Kirby Jr may have retired from his firm on June 30 2007, but thanks to his victory for Nintendo, his name will be remembered by the countless Nintendo fans around the world.

	As for Universal and Nintendo’s current relationship, it would seem the two companies have made amends, and will be collaborating on a major project soon.  This project is an official Nintendo theme park at Universal Studios Japan called Nintendo World.  According to the most recent estimates, “the first version of the land will open in spring 2020 at Universal Studios Japan, ideally, in time for the 2020 Summer Olympics in Tokyo” (10).  The park is set to have two rides upon opening, one based on Mario Kart the other on Yoshi, and the park will allegedly have a more interactive element in the form of magnetic wristband guests can use to interact with the park itself.  The wristband’s function will be to “track their (guests’) scores gained through interactions in the land as well as on the rides – and interestingly, Williams also said that this scorekeeping will interface ‘back with your game console so you can build on it and come back again.’”(10).  Currently, there are no official statements regarding if or when a version of Nintendo World will open in Universal Studios Hollywood or Orlando, and even if construction were to begin today, it would be several years until the park opened.

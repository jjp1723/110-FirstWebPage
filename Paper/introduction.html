	King v Donkey, an Introduction:
	<p>
	I am a big Nintendo fan, and I love almost every game they have made so far.  I recently played the most recent Donkey Kong game, Donkey Kong Country Tropical Freeze, and I thoroughly enjoyed it.  However, this game, and perhaps Donkey Kong himself may not have ever existed if a certain game from roughly 37 years ago had panned out differently.  This event was a lawsuit filed by Universal Studios in 1982 against Nintendo, claiming that Donkey Kong violated their trademark for King Kong.

	However, before jumping into the court case, it would be best to add some context to Donkey Kong and its development.  Released in 1981, Donkey Kong was the brainchild of Shigeru Miyamoto and his development team.  According to an interview in February of 2000, the game that would later become Donkey Kong was originally meant to become a Popeye game.  To quote Miyamoto himself, “it was decided that we were going to have a big, hulking character (Brutus) and a small character (Popeye). Eventually, the plan changed, and it was decided we would proceed with making the game without using the Popeye concept... And with that, as our small hero we cast Mario, and as our hulking villain we created Donkey Kong” (6).  When designing Donkey Kong himself, Miyamoto wanted to “make him a dumb character.  We then set it up so that, rather than being Mario’s arch enemy, he would be a pet gorilla of Mario’s who had escaped” (6), so he wasn’t meant to be a true villain like Brutus would have been if it had remained a Popeye game.  Donkey Kong was also one of Nintendo’s first games developed with a global launch in mind, which is the reason Donkey was chosen as DK’s name, as Miyamoto learned that “donkey” also meant stupid in English, and thus Donkey Kong, also known as Stupid Ape, was born.  The game would find incredibly positive reception in the United States and Canada, and would become a staple of gaming in its time.

	However, the game, and Donkey Kong himself, still maintained many similarities to another well-known gorilla in media: King Kong.  Like the classic movie, Donkey Kong escapes from captivity, kidnaps a young woman, and proceeds to climb a tower with her.  Due to this extreme similarity, as well as the use of the word ‘Kong’ in the antagonist’s name, it isn’t hard to see why Universal Studios concluded that Donkey Kong as actually King Kong.  Surprisingly, Donkey Kong originally inspired the owner of Tiger Electronic Toys to “produce a similar game.  In September 1981, he received an exclusive King Kong license for video games” (1).  When Nintendo began to apply for a trademark for Donkey Kong and reached an agreement with Coleco Industries “which provided that Coleco would produce Donkey Kong in cartridge form for use with a home video game it was beginning to market” (1), Universal approached Coleco and Nintendo stating that their cartridge infringed Universal’s King Kong rights.  Universal would also approach other companies involved with the Donkey Kong games, such as Atari and Ruby-Spears, and both came to agreements in which Universal would not sue them in exchange for a percentage of gross sales.  When Universal approached Nintendo, they demanded that Nintendo “cease all sales of the game, get rid of any unsold copies they were sitting on and give Universal all the money they'd ever made from the game.” (7), to which Nintendo refused to comply.  This would eventually lead to Universal Studios filing a lawsuit in 1982 that Donkey Kong is in fact King Kong, and that the games are in violation of Universal’s claimed “trademark in the King Kong name and another King Kong character by virtue of recent assignments.

	The Court Case:
	<p>
	Court proceeding began in 1983 and would be handled under New York General Business Law.  The acting judge for the proceedings was Robert Sweet and Nintendo’s representing lawyer was John Kirby Jr, whose name may seem familiar, which I will get into later.  A key part of the lawsuit was determining “what he (King Kong) looks like” (2), as that would be essential for Universal proving that Donkey Kong was King Kong.  On the other hand, Nintendo claimed that “Universal is precluded from asserting trademark rights in King Kong by the doctrines of collateral and judicial estoppel, because the issues in this action were fully litigated in a previous action in federal court in California during 1975-81” (2), which was referring to a prior case between Universal and Richard Cooper, the son of Merian C. Cooper who was the writer of the original King Kong story and screenplay for the classic 1933 movie.  John Kirby would bring this case to light, as in it Universal themselves proved that “the character of King Kong was in fact public domain and free to use by anyone, so long as it did not copy the plot of the original 1933 movie which was owned by RKO Pictures” (8).  Another fact on Nintendo’s side was “There are also numerous third-party commercial uses of the King Kong name. This would not justify an infringement of the name, but it would have harmed attempts to gain a secondary meaning by making it harder for consumers to distinguish a single source” (4).  It was these points that would be key to Nintendo winning the case against Universal, and was also crucial to Nintendo being able to enforce their counterclaim of “vicarious copyright infringement by Universal arising out of the distribution of the Tiger/King Kong home video cartridge” (3), as Universal’s game allegedly violated Nintendo’s trademark for Donkey Kong.  Judge Sweet would find this counterclaim valid, and “ruled that Tiger Electronics’ King Kong game was too similar to Donkey Kong, and Nintendo received $58 million from the profits as well as legal costs and other damages” (8).
	<p>
	Universal, not satisfied with this result, would appeal the court ruling in 1984 under the reason that “Universal failed to raise a question of fact on the issue of the likelihood of consumer confusion and this Nintendo was entitled to summary judgement on the Lanham Act claim” (5).  However, this appeal would be dismissed, as “Universal failed to present any evidence indicating that Donkey Kong will have an adverse effect on King Kong’s reputation or deprive the mark of its distinctiveness” (5).
